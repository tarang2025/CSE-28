    <p id="1"><h2>global warming</h2>
    Global warming refers to the long-term increase in Earth's average surface temperature, primarily driven by human activities since the mid-20th century.
 This warming is caused by the accumulation of greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide (CO₂), methane (CH₄), and nitrous oxide (N₂O), in the atmosphere, which trap heat from the sun that would otherwise escape into space.
 The primary source of these gases is the burning of fossil fuels for energy, transportation, and industrial processes, along with deforestation and agricultural practices.</p>
